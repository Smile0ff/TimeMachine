To run project you need to make next steps:
1. install/update npm packages (prbbly you need to manually update major version of the package)
2. install jspm packages
3. install mjml globally
4. install less globally
5. run gulp command to create new build

Project doesn't have installed HTTP server, so you will need to install it manually, also you will need a PHP installed to handle mocked data for AJAX.
